### Project Overview

 The Lending Club connects people who need money with investors. As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back. So Using the Decision Tree model, classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full to help investors make a decision of lending the money to a particular borrower. 


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a better understanding of how to build a decision tree model. In this project, I have applied the following concepts.
Train-test split, Correlation between the features, Decision Tree Modeling, Evaluation Metrics, and Graphviz plotting.
