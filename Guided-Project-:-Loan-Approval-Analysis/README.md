### Project Overview

 Dream Housing Finance Inc. specializes in home loans across different market segments - rural, urban and semi-urban. Their loan eligibility process is based on customer details provided while filling an online application form.

### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I had a better grip on working with pandas. In this project I  applied the operations like Dataframe slicing, Dataframe aggregation, Pivot table operations, etc


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Initially read and understood the data then load the .csv file and categorized the Categorical and Numerical values than got the number of NaN values and filled them with the mode value(the most occurring value) of the bank next  checked the avg loan amount w.r.t Gender and Employment type than Calculated the percentage of loan approval based on various parameters such as Employment type, Martial status, etc finally compared the Income/ Credit History vs Loan Amount so the approval of the loan can be determined.
